# pong3d

#### Pong3D using PyProcessing ([py.processing.org](py.processing.org))

## How to run :

You need the command line version of processing.py

These instructions come from the [processing.py official website](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/command-line/) :
 
Ensure that you can run Java by typing the following on the command line:

$ `java -version`

If it is not 1.8.0 even if you installed java 1.8.0, you can search for the absolute path of your java 1.8.0 executable

You'll also need to obtain the standalone version of Processing.py. Choose the appropriate link according to your platform:

[Mac OS X](http://py.processing.org/processing.py-macosx.tgz)

Windows : [64-bit](http://py.processing.org/processing.py-windows64.zip), [32-bit](http://py.processing.org/processing.py-windows32.zip)

Linux : [64-bit](http://py.processing.org/processing.py-linux64.tgz), [32-bit](http://py.processing.org/processing.py-linux32.tgz)

Inside the archive you will find the `processing-py.jar` file. You can run it using

$ `java -jar processing-py.jar <script>`

Or use the absolute path for your java executable
